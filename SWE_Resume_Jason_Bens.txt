\section{\underline{Biography}}
I'm a hardware engineer at Loon, previously part of Google X.  I've been designing hardware for the past six years, but I'm also interested in and have experience in software and firmware development.  I'll be relocating with my family to Berlin in April, and intend to take this opportunity to transition into a software-focused position.

\section{\underline{Software Experience}}
  \textbf{Electrical Engineer}\hfill Seattle, Washington\\
  \textbf{Pensar Development}\hfill \emph{August 2015 - September 2018}\smallskip
  \begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Wrote several python utility scripts for firmware updates, log scraping, and reporting on prototype devices under development.
    \item Developed a suite of automated manufacturing tests in Python and NI Labview for circuit-board validation of my boards at the contract manufacturer.
  \end{itemize}
  \medskip
  
  \textbf{Research Intern} \hfill Keihanna Science City, Kyoto, Japan \\
  \textbf{Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International} \hfill \emph{July 2012 - August 2013}\smallskip
  \begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Implemented a stacked denoising autoencoder in Python to generate hypothetical functional MRI (fMRI) activations.
    \item Developed stimulus routines in Matlab to collect data on behavioural tasks from human test subjects.
    \item Analyzed fMRI, MEG, EEG, and anatomical MRI data using Python to locate and visualize neural activations measured during experiments.
  \end{itemize}
  \medskip

  \textbf{Projects and Extracurriculars}
  \begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Implemented a waveform generator in C and Assembler on an ARM microcontroller capable of generating arbitrary waveforms up to 1 MHz.
    \item Developed firmware and device drivers for LCD display, capacitive-touch, Wi-Fi, and I/O peripherals on an embedded microcontroller demonstration board.
  \end{itemize}
  
\section{\underline{Hardware Experience}}
  \textbf{Hardware Engineer}\hfill Mountain View, California\\
  \textbf{Google X, Loon LLC}\hfill \emph{January 2020 - Current}\smallskip
  \begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item As the main avionics engineer on Loon's next generation of flight vehicle, defined the requirements of, designed, and implemented a new avionics platform, launching Q1 2021 (Phase 1).
    \item Designed from scratch a new sensor fusion board for real-time flight data acquisition and controller actuation, forming the backbone of the next-gen flight vehicle's control system.
    \item Refactored an existing ballast dispenser board to simplify the design, removing or modifying several unnecessary power supplies and peripherals.
    \item Helped keep Loon weird by sneaking cat-themed art onto new circuit boards.
  \end{itemize}
  \medbreak
  
  \textbf{Electrical Engineer}\hfill Seattle, Washington\\
  \textbf{Pensar Development}\hfill \emph{August 2015 - September 2018}\smallskip
  \begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Designed the schematics and circuit-board layout of several USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 hub boards for a medical ultrasound device.
    \item Spearheaded the EMC effort to reduce the device's RF emissions from 30 dB above the IEC-60601-1 limit to 15 dB below the limit using both electrical and mechanical modifications.
    \item Coordinated with local fabrication labs and larger contract manufacturers to prototype the device and bring it into production.
    \item Performed signal integrity measurements on high speed lines (DDR, USB 3.0, low MHz sine wave) and designed mitigations to reduce the effects of nearby RF coupling.
  \end{itemize}
  \medskip
  
  \textbf{Electrical Engineer}\hfill Mukilteo, Washington\\
  \textbf{Electroimpact}\hfill \emph{September 2014 - August 2015}\smallskip
