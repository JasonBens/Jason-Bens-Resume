\section{Biography}
I'm an electrical engineer interested in finding applications for deep learning in computer-science and engineering fields. I enjoy working with embedded systems and playing with microcontrollers. Eventually, I want to bridge the gap between humans, machines, and AI, and find ways to combine them to make something greater than the sum of its parts. In my off-time, I follow my interests through online courses such as those offered by Coursera or edX.

    \emph{June 2013 - August 2013} \\
    Under the supervision of Dr. Yukiyasu Kamitani in the Department of Neuroinformatics, I performed research into machine learning, primarily focusing on the application of neural networks, especially deep learning architectures, to the decoding of object representations in the brain. Primarily, I worked on implementing a stacked denoising autoencoder in python using Theano to perform generic object recognition with the goal of using fMRI data to predict the neural response of a subject when presented with an image.

    \emph{July 2012 - April 2013} \\
    Working under the supervision of Dr. Noriko Yamagishi and Dr. Matthew DeBrecht in the Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, we performed research into the mechanisms of visual attention, as well as neural plasticity. My primary duties were developing software using MATLAB to perform visual experiments, as well as pattern extraction using the resulting EEG, MEG, and fMRI data. Additional duties involved learning to use new software packages, and developing documentation and guides to perform routine data processing steps using these new packages.
